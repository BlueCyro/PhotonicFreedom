# Photonic Freedom

<b>This is a [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod that lets you change your graphical settings in Neos.</b>


# DISCLAIMER:
<b><i>This mod lets you change the intended look of neos. Some worlds are built neos' defaults in mind so if things look bad - it's YOUR fault!</b></i>

# Settings you can change:

- <b>Ambient occlusion (Both built-in and from [AmplifyCreations](https://github.com/AmplifyCreations/AmplifyOcclusion) - the latter is in neos by default too)</b>
- <b>Auto Exposure</b>
- <b>Bloom</b>
- <b>Chromatic Aberration</b>
- <b>Color Grading</b>
- <b>Depth of Field</b>
- <b>Grain</b>
- <b>Lens Distortion</b>
- <b>Motion Blur</b>
- <b>Screen-Space Reflections</b>
- <b>Vignette</b>


<b>Most fields on these settings are exposed (barring curve and reference types), and are saved to config files within `nml_mods/Photonic_Settings`</b>

<b>You can find the in-game settings in your regular settings menu on the right side, simply scroll down to see the extra options.</b>

# Known Issues:

- <b>Some effects don't work in VR - you should stick to mostly color grading, bloom and AO effects for VR unless you wanna feel like you're swimming in a fishbowl or have vaseline in your eye</b>

Enjoy!
