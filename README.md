# Photonic Freedom

This is a [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod that lets you change your graphical settings in
Resonite.

# DISCLAIMER:

***This mod lets you change the intended look of Resonite. Some worlds are built with Resonite's defaults in mind so if things
look bad - it's YOUR fault!***

# Settings you can change:

- **Ambient occlusion (Both built-in and from [AmplifyCreations](https://github.com/AmplifyCreations/AmplifyOcclusion))
  ** - the latter is in Resonite by default too
- Auto Exposure
- Bloom
- Chromatic Aberration
- Color Grading
- Depth of Field
- Grain
- Lens Distortion
- Motion Blur
- Screen-Space Reflections
- Vignette

Most fields on these settings are exposed (barring curve and reference types), and are saved to config files
within `rml_mods/Photonic_Settings`

You can find the in-game settings in your regular settings menu on the right side, simply scroll down to see the extra
options.

# Known Issues:

- **Some effects don't work in VR** - you should stick to mostly color grading, bloom and AO effects for VR unless you
  wanna feel like you're swimming in a fishbowl or have vaseline in your eye

Enjoy!
