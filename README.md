# Photonic Freedom

### This is a [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod that lets you change your graphical settings in Neos.


# DISCLAIMER:
## This mod lets you change the intended look of neos. Some worlds are built neos' defaults in mind so if things look bad - it's YOUR fault!

# Settings you can change:

- #### Ambient occlusion (Both built-in and from [AmplifyCreations](https://github.com/AmplifyCreations/AmplifyOcclusion) - the latter is in neos by default too)
- #### Auto Exposure
- #### Bloom
- #### Chromatic Aberration
- #### Color Grading
- #### Depth of Field
- #### Grain
- #### Lens Distortion
- #### Motion Blur
- #### Screen-Space Reflections
- #### Vignette


#### Most fields on these settings are exposed (barring curve and reference types), and are saved to config files within `nml_mods/Photonic_Settings`

#### You can find the in-game settings in your regular settings menu on the right side, simply scroll down to see the extra options.


# Examples:

# Known Issues:

- #### Some effects don't work in VR - you should stick to mostly color grading, bloom and AO effects for VR unless you wanna feel like you're swimming in a fishbowl or have vaseline in your eye

# Enjoy!
