# PhotonicFreedom
A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod that adds settings for Ambient Occlusion and Motion Blur.

Note: This will currently apply the selected options to not just your view, but all cameras that exist in the world at the time of toggling a setting.


Disclaimer: This will allow you to alter the intended look of neos. Some maps make use of AO and bloom and such to look correct. If things look bad - it's your fault.

Also note that this mod can and very much will break in the future. Don't rely on it working or for medical purposes. This code deviates heavily from Neos' intended design philosophies and is liable to change and/or stop working without warning.
